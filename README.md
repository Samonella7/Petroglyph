# Petroglyph
A simple online multiplayer game inspired by KimboRambo's Cavemen Hunters (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1WxwF6vM5Q). Petroglyph is almost identical, but it features online play. 

To play Petroglyph, go to the releases page and download Petroglyph.jar. You can then run it using a recent version of Java, which you can get at https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml

Petroglyph was made using Eclipse-oxygen, and targets JRE 1.8.0_181. The recommended way to modify the source code is to use the Eclipse import wizard to import this directly from GitHub.
